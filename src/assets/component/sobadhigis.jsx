         <h3 className="text-3xl font-serif">My name is Aisha, and I am a passionate student of Computer Science. From an early stage, I discovered that I enjoy solving problems and creating things that are useful and meaningful. This passion led me into the world of technology and programming, where I can turn ideas into reality.

       Currently, I am on the journey of becoming a Full Stack Developer. I spend my time learning both frontend and backend development, building projects that combine creativity with logic. Through this process, I am gaining confidence in writing code, understanding how systems work, and connecting the different parts of an application together.

       I also have a strong interest in design. Tools like Figma and Canva allow me to express my creativity and improve the look and feel of my projects. I believe that a developer should not only build functional applications but also make them beautiful and user-friendly. This balance between functionality and design inspires me every day.

       In my studies, I focus on being active, consistent, and disciplined. I know that success comes only with hard work and patience, so I push myself to stay motivated. I see challenges not as problems, but as opportunities to grow. Every error in my code and every bug I fix brings me closer to becoming a stronger developer.

      One of my biggest dreams is to build a professional portfolio that reflects my journey. Each project I complete is a step forward, showing my progress and dedication. I want my portfolio to not only showcase my skills but also inspire others who are walking the same path.

      Looking into the future, I see myself working as a developer on an international level. I dream of joining teams that create impactful software, contributing to solutions that help people and businesses around the world. At the same time, I want to use my skills to build my own projects, maybe even start a tech company one day inshaâ€™Allah.

       I know the road ahead is not easy, but I am ready to keep learning, improving, and exploring. I believe in continuous growth, and I am committed to becoming the best version of myself both personally and professionally. With dedication, faith, and hard work, I am confident that the future will be bright.</h3>
